# My Advent of Code Journey - 2023
This is my first time participating. To be honest, I have a lot of respect for algorithms.
So, let's see how this goes. Even though I try to solve these every day, it's probably not going to happen.

## Language
C# because it's a beautiful language. The only thing I miss from Rust is the match operator and compile-time macros for including files.
I know some people use Advent of Code to push themselves out of their comfort zone and learn new languages, but this year I would just be happy to solve the puzzles at all.

I also don't desperately try to push for optimization. If it runs pretty fast, I'm fine with it.

Details: `.NET version: 8.0.100 - C# version 12`
